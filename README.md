# Food REST API

I have designed and implemented a RESTful API for food services, offering extensive information on a wide range of culinary options, encompassing Pizza, Pasta, Desserts, Healthy Bowls, and Beverages using Spring and Java. This API serves as a robust and versatile resource, ideal for the development of applications or websites that center around menu options and streamline the process of online food ordering. It adheres to CRUD principles, enabling the seamless addition, deletion, updating, and retrieval of data.
